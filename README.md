## LinearRegression.R
A linear regression model I did on some store data. Refined model in several steps to generate more accurate predictions.

## LogisticRegression.R
Logistic regression performed on sample loan data.

## LinReg.R
Another linear regression model I made using some AirBnB data. Worth noting: I had to log the data here as the data was not normal based on the histograms and QQ plots that were created to check the distribution. Data that doesn't follow a normal distribution causes problems for linear regression models. In order to work around this, transforming the data to make it normal helps. I also included a lot of code centered around checking the 5 assumptions for linear regression models.

## GradDesc.R
I coded my own gradient descent algorithm in this one. If you go through the whole thing and compare the coefficients with the output from the lm() function, you'll see that they match!

## EDA.R
This is some exploratory data analysis I performed on AirBnB data. I created several bar graphs as well as scatterplots.
